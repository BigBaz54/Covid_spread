# COVID-19 Spread Analysis

This project analyzes the spread of the COVID-19 virus across countries based on factors like geographic position, urban population percentage, and climatic conditions.

## Motivation

A previous study examined the relationship between COVID-19 spread and latitude, but received criticism for not considering enough factors like urbanization levels and climate. This project aims to revisit that analysis by incorporating additional variables to better understand the key influencers of virus propagation.

## Data sources
- Urban population: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL
- Total population: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
- Country position: https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699#file-countries_codes_and_coordinates-csv
- Mean temperature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_yearly_temperature
- COVID confirmed cases: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/versions/143
- Climate classification: https://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/data/Koeppen-Geiger-ASCII.zip
- Mortality rate: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/coronavirus-covid19-mortality-rate-by-country and https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

## Data Processing

The data processing steps include:

1. **Country Selection**: A subset of 159 countries was selected for which all required data was available across the different sources. The difflib library was used to match country names across datasets by calculating similarity scores, using a threshold of 0.8.

2. **Geographic Positions**: The average latitude and longitude for each country was obtained from Tadas Talaikis' dataset, which provides the mean geographic position.

3. **Climate Data**:
   - **Temperature**: Mean temperature data for each country was extracted from Wikipedia.
   - **Climate Classification**: The KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification was obtained from the University of Vienna's dataset, which provides climate data for over 90,000 points globally. For each country, the nearest point was identified by calculating the distance using the Haversine formula, and the corresponding climate classification was assigned.

4. **Population Data**:
   - The total population and urban population figures for 2020 were retrieved from the World Bank dataset.
   - The urban population percentage was calculated by dividing the urban population by the total population.

5. **COVID-19 Data**:
   - **Confirmed Cases**: The cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from Kaggle and Worldometers, available as a time series with daily data points. For countries with multiple regions, the cases were summed up.
   - **Mortality Rate**: The mortality rate was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

6. **Time Series Truncation**: Described below.

The final dataset contained the following features for each country:

- Country name
- Latitude and longitude
- Urban and total population
- Mortality rate
- Mean temperature
- Climate classification
- Truncated COVID-19 confirmed cases time series

## Analysis

### Time Series Truncation

To extract a comparable spread indicator across countries, the COVID-19 case time series were truncated to isolate periods of largely unmitigated viral spread, before government interventions became highly impactful.

The time series were first smoothed using a moving average.

The derivatives of the smoothed curves were then calculated, and the maximum derivative point was located. Moving backwards and forwards from this point, the curves were truncated at points where the derivative fell below empirically chosen thresholds of 5% and 70% respectively.

### Spread Rate Calculation

Four methods were evaluated to calculate a single spread rate indicator from the truncated case curves:

1. Linear Regression

</div>

   This proved to be a poor model for viral spread.

2. Exponential Regression

</div>

   Exponential regression provided a good fit and was selected as the spread indicator, after min-max scaling of coefficients.

3. Case Doubling Rate

    In order to make the result less sensitive to the initial conditions, the doubling rate was calculated as the average of the doubling rates on the last 75% of the time series.

   <img src="report/img/time_double.png" width="100%">
</div>
    
    This method was considered but not used for the final analysis.

4. Daily Reproduction Ratio

   It corresponds to the mean relative increase in cases from one day to the next. It was calculated as the average of the daily reproduction ratios on the last 75% of the time series.
   The formula is: $R = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (C_{i+1} - C_i) / C_i$, where $C_i$ is the number of cases on day $i$.

   This method was considered but not used for the final analysis.

The spread rates calculated were then compared by visualizing on a common scale the ones for a diverse set of countries.

The exponential regression method was finally chosen as the spread indicator for the analysis.
